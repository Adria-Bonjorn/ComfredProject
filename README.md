# ComfredProject
Development of a tool to simplify machine/material prescription for non-technical Comfred employees.
This tool is the next step of some of my PersonalProjectsPython scripts that had similar functions but console based.
In order to make the tool accessible, I'm gonna set up a user interface using PyQt5 and QtDesigner.
This scripts are not meant to be malicious user proof so I'm going to focus in the functionability of the tool assuming the correct use by users.
